[section Motivation]
Sometimes getting and storing information about a template type at runtime is required. For such cases a construction like `&typeid(T)` or C++11 class `std::type_index` is usually used. And that is the point, where problems strat:

* `typeid(T)` and `std::type_index` require Run Time Type Info (RTTI)
* some implementations of `typeid(T)` strips const, volatile and references from type, while others don't
* some compilers have bugs and do not correctly compare `std::type_info` objects across shared libraries
* only a few implementations already provide `std::type_index`
* no easy way to store type info without stripping const, volatile and references
* no nice and portable way to get human readable type names

Boost.TypeIndex was designed to work around those issues.

ï»¿[note `T` means type here. Think of it as `T` in `template <class T>` ]

[section Getting started]

In short:
Just replace `typeid(T)`, `&typeid(T)` with `boost::type_id<T>()` and `std::type_index`, `const std::type_info&` with `boost::type_index`. For cases when RTTI is actually required, replace `typeid(variable)` with `boost::type_id_rtti_only(variable)`.  That's all, you are now using Boost.TypeIndex.

To get nice human readable names, use the `name_demangled()` member function:
``
type_index ti = type_id<T>();
std::string nice_name = ti.name_demangled();
...
std::string nice_name_with_const_volatile_ref = template_id_with_cvr<ParamT&>().name_demangled();
``

`template_index` and `type_index` provide the full set of comparison operators, hashing functions and ostream operators. Thay can be used with any container class.

If you need to preserve `const`, `volatile` and references, use `boost::template_index` instead of `boost::type_index`; `boost::template_id_with_cvr<T>()` instead of `boost::type_id<T>()`.

[section Examples]
All code in the examples will work with and without RTTI support.

Class that allows to register a given type only once. 
``
class types_registry {
    unordered_set<type_index> types_;

public:
    template <class T>
    void add_type() {
        type_index ti = type_id<T>();
        std::cout << "Adding type " << ti << " to registry \n";
        if (!types_.insert(ti).second) 
            throw std::logic_error("Type " + ti.name_demangled() + " already registered");
    }

    template <class T>
    bool has_type() const {
        return types_.cend() != types_.find(type_id<T>());
    }
};

int main () {
    types_registry tr;
    tr.add_type<int>();
    tr.add_type<float>();

    std::cout << "Has type int: " << tr.has_type<int>() 
        << "\nHas type std::string: " << tr.has_type<std::string>()
        << '\n';
}

``

This will output:
``
Adding type int to registry
Adding type float to registry
Has type int: 1
Has type std::string: 0
``

Another example, this time checking for exact parameter match.
`my_unary_function` is a class, that stores a function with result type `ResultT` and any input parameter type. In `operator()`, it checks for input parameter match and then executes the stored function:

``
template <class ResultT>
class my_unary_function {
    void*           function_ptr_;
    template_index  exact_param_t_;
    ...

    template <class ParamT>
    ResultT operator()(ParamT& v) {
        BOOST_ASSERT(exact_param_t_ == template_id_with_cvr<ParamT&>());
        return (static_cast<ResultT(ParamT&)>(function_ptr_))(v);
    }
};
``

[section Performance]

`type_index` and `template_index` classes hold a single pointer, so they are easy and fast to copy. Calls to `const char* name()` do not require dynamic memory allocation and usually just return a pointer to an array of chars in a read-only section of the binary image. Comparison operators are optimized as much as possible, and will at worst execute a single `std::strcmp`. Calls to `std::string name_demangled()` for `type_index` do usually require dynamic memory allocation and some computations, so they are not recomended for usage in performance critical sections. Calls to `std::string name_demangled()` for `template_index` only require a single `std::strlen` call and are considerably faster than `std::string name_demangled()` for `type_index`.

`template_index` uses the `BOOST_CURRENT_FUNCTION` macro, which could lead to code bloat. In those cases where preserving `const`, `volatile` and references is not needed prefer using `type_index`.
